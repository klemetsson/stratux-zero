PCB Fabrication Notes:

1) 4 layer 1.6mm FR-4 with JLCPCB stackup and JLC7628
2) ENIG
3) Black solder mask
4) J1 holes may be adjusted as long as 0.18 mm pins fit
5) Solder mask should cover bottom layer pads of MP1 and header for J2 as per the file
6) The 4 pads under J2 should also have the pads covered with solder mask on bottom layer as per the file
